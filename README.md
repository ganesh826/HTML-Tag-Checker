#HTML Tag Checker

This was a school project to conclude a data structures and algorithms course.

Code written by Sam Messina and Devon Guinn.

##What it is

Our goal was to create a tag checker for html documents. We use a stack to store opening tags as they are found and check them against closing tags as they come up. 

##How to use it
It's written in java, so you will need the JRE to run the program. Once you run the program, you can simply input the URL of the document you are trying to check. This can be a local file path if preferred. The program will run automatically from there, and will open up two files: the errors found, and the original HTML document with errors pointed out in comments.

##That's it!

This was a fun project for us. If you want to try it out, be my guest!
